# Problem
Moving to a new city can prove challenging and be a source of stress, especially when deciding which is the most suitable area to live in.
This project is aiming at helping people decide which is the most suitable neighborhood in a given city given their interests.

# Audience
This Project can in reality be useful for Any individual looking to get more information on how venues are distributed among neighborhood. 
for example : an eutrepreneur looking for an area where to open up a shop will be able to assess the competition density with this tool.
Here the project was designed more specifically for individuals looking for a new home. this tool will help them decide which is the most adequate neighborhood for them given a set of interests.

# Data used
I am leveraging on   
  1/ foursquare API to fetch all the venues in each neighborhood. 
  2/ GPS data scraped from internet websites

once all this data retrieved i will follow a precise methodology to build a score for each neighborhood based on the interests.
The methodology will be constructed to distinguish as best as possible neighborhood : depending on 
  1/ frequency of venues
  2/ density
  3/ overall density of the venues
  4/ size of the neighborhood
  etc...
